## How to Navigate

1. **Navigation Bar:**  
   At the top of every page, you will find the navigation bar with links to **Home**, **About Me**, **Projects**, **Resume**, and **Contact**. Simply click on any link to visit that section.

2. **Responsive Design:**  
   The site is designed to be mobile-friendly. On smaller devices, the navigation bar and content will adjust automatically to fit your screen.

3. **Chatbot:**  
   A chatbot is located in the bottom-right corner on every page. It is interactive and can be minimized by clicking the arrow icon if it gets in the way.

4. **Resume Viewer:**
